Although Momo stands for peaches in Japanese, Ryu’s dog was originally named Moe. Once the expression, “Mo money, Mo problems,” caught on, the Yano household began calling their dog Momo.

Despite spending over 43% of his day on the toilet, Ryu’s asshole remains tighter than the average male, which he attributes to 'a good diet, exercise, and never using more than 3 fingers when pleasuring oneself.'

Ryu’s favorite sport is baseball but not for the reasons you might think. While it’s true he enjoys pitching and catching, nothing gives him greater pleasure than slapping his teammates’ asses after hard-earned game.

Many people assume the name “Ryu” is short for something, but it’s actually an acronym for “Rubbing your unit,” a classic euphemism for masturbation.

A case which still baffles modern day doctors, Ryu has a unique altitudinal disorder, where if he moves to quickly up or down stairs, all the liquids in his body start pouring out his sweat glands. He must limit himself to a three-story per 5 minute pace or risk expelling his sweat all over Venable apartments.

People tend to be surprised by the fact that momo can lick his own penis, but people are even more surprised by the fact that Ryu can also lick his own penis.
